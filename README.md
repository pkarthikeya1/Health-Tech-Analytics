## Brand Awareness Strategy

To increase brand awareness, a different approach is needed.

- **Email Campaigns:**
  - While the CTR for Email campaigns is the highest overall, specific campaign types must be evaluated.
  - Covid Awareness campaigns have a CTR of 14.51%, ranking third after Policy Information campaigns.
- **Social Media Campaigns:**
  - Covid Awareness campaigns perform well in terms of CTR at 13.11%, though the number of signups is negligible compared to Product Promotion campaigns.
  - Offer Announcement campaigns also show high CTR at 12.67%.

Despite the lower signup numbers, campaigns like Covid Awareness and Offer Announcements on social media platforms have strong CTRs, indicating good potential for increasing brand awareness. Allocating more budget to these campaigns can enhance brand visibility.

- **TV Campaigns:**
  - The number of signups from TV campaigns is low, and the CAC is very high at $10.47.
  - Considering the limited impact and high cost, it is recommended to stop or reduce TV campaign spending and reallocate the budget to more effective channels.

By focusing on high-CTR campaigns for brand awareness and high-signup campaigns for customer acquisition, a balanced and efficient marketing strategy can be achieved.
